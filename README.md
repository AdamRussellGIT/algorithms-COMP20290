# *Algorithms Portfolio - Adam Russell*

This is a repository that I maintained and updated throughout the semester for Algorithms COMP20290. It contains all algorithms developed over the course of the moduel in practicals, along with some elementary timings for some of the algorithms.

# Navigating The Repo

## *Classes*

### Main.java
This class can be run to see implementations of all the other classes (e.g. sorted arrays after calling sorting algorithms from the Sorting.java class). 

### RussianPeasant.java
This class contains the implementation for the Russian Peasant Multiplication Algorithm, alongside timings for different sizes of integers (e.g. 1x1, 235x651 etc).

### FibRecursion.java
This class contains an implementation of a recursive solution to finding the nth fibonacci numbers, along with timings for differet values of n.

# Versioning

Regular commits were made over the course of the module, as practicals were completed and as certain algorithms and files were edited and refined.
